# CHANGELOG

## vX.Y.0 (future)

## 2.20250912.0

### Wrap-up

This release primarily marks Invidious companion's ascend out of beta and its stable integration thereof into Invidious!

For those unaware Invidious companion is the successor to the `inv-sig-helper` tool, designed to securely pass YouTube's attestation checks and allow for the efficient retrieval and playback of video streams reliably.

Companion delivers YouTube fixes faster since itâ€™s built on the community-driven [YouTube.js](https://github.com/LuanRT/YouTube.js) project, used by many open source projects such as [FreeTube](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube).

For more information see https://github.com/iv-org/invidious-companion and https://docs.invidious.io/installation/

But companion isn't the only new thing in this release!

Invidious will no longer error out completely as soon as a single item failed to parse in search results, channel pages, etc. Instead it now handles it gracefully by substituting those problematic items with an error card and rendering the page normally.

The player has gained some quality of life features such as being able to choose a default playlist for videos to be added to, or persisting caption appearance settings across the session.

Base Invidious video retrieval without Invidious companion has also been made more stable.

And finally a significant amount of bugs were fixed alongside many other minor improvements.

### New features & important changes
#### For Users
  - DASH is now enabled by default due to YouTube's removal of the 720p non-dash streams
  - Javascript licencing info has been added to all of Invidious' scripts, restoring full compatibility with LibreJS
  - There is no longer an option for a text captcha during registration due to the shutdown (presumably) of the upstream service
  - Parse errors in feeds will no longer render the entire feed unusable and instead will substitute only the broken items with error cards
  - Keyboard shortcuts have been added to configure caption styles:
    - `-`,`=` can be used to change the font size
    - `o` can be used to cycle the opacity of the caption text
    - `w` can be used to cycle the opacity of the caption box
  - Caption styles changed through the VideoJS menu will now persist
  - You can now choose a default playlist to add videos to instead of needing to manually select one each time

#### For instance owners
  - Invidious companion support has been added to replace the deprecated inv-sig-helper
  - **DASH is now the default resolution! Please ensure that your instances can withstand the significantly higher bandwidth usage or manually configure your instance to use non-dash streams by default**
  - Invidious will now warn when it is unable to connect to the database instead of failing silently
  - **The text captcha during registration has been removed due to the shutdown (presumably) of the upstream service**

#### For developers
  - Dependabot has been added to keep Github Actions and Docker dependencies up-to-date.
  - CI version matrix has been bumped to the latest patch release for each minor version
  - The versions of Crystal that we test in CI/CD are now: `1.12.2`, `1.13.3`, `1.14.1`, `1.15.1`, `1.16.3`
  - `Kilt` is no longer a dependency of Invidious
  - The ARM64 docker image builds (and the test CI) has been changed to use Github's ARM64 runner instead of QEMU
  - **An "error" JSON object can now be returned in various API responses in-place of an item that has failed to parse**:

      ```json
        {
          "type": "parse-error",
          "errorMessage": "...",
          "errorBacktrace": "..."
        }
      ```

### Bugs fixed
#### User-side
  - Livestream will now be properly proxied again allowing playback from the UI
  - The proxy video preference for logged-in users will no longer get ignored when a default value is set by the instance
  - Fixes the missing `label` key error on select search results and other feeds
  - Invidious will no longer strip out spaces from search queries when navigating back from the preferences page
  - Restores functionality to the `subscriptions:true` search keyword
  - The channel RSS feeds will no longer have an empty title
  - Individual community posts can be viewed again
  - The playlists tab of channels can be viewed again
  - Fix incorrect dates, region, etc of videos
  - Various minor fixes were made to how video info is extracted in setups without Invidious companion to improve resiliency and chances of success
  - Fix issue where the notification count becomes `TRUE` rather than an actual number
#### For instance owners
  - Fixed a minor typo in config.example.yml (`effet` -> `effect`)
#### For developers
  - The docker image test CI will now properly check whether Invidious has started

### Wrap-up

This release brings the long awaited feature of supporting multiple audio tracks in a video, some bug fixes and UX improvements, and many other things primarily oriented to self-hosting instances, and developers using the API.

The `Community` channel tab has been replaced by `Posts` in light of YouTube changes, but the URL remains the same.

Tamil is now available as an interface language

Automatic instance redirects will no longer have the chance to annoyingly redirect to the same instance you're on.

Due to their requirements for video playback, Invidious will log warning messages when either inv-sig-helper, `po_token` or `visitor_data` is not configured

Invidious is now able to listen through a UNIX socket

User notifications are now batched for each channel

**The minimum Crystal version supported by Invidious now `1.12.0`**

## v2.20241110.0

### Wrap-up

This release is most importantly here to fix to the annoying "Youtube API returned error 400"
error that prevented all channel pages from loading.

If you're updating from the previous release, it provides no improvements on the ability to play
videos. If updating from a commit in-between release, it removes the "Please sign in" error caused
by a previous attempt at restoring video playback on large instances.

In the preferences, a new option allows for control of video preload. When enabled, this option
tells the browser to load the video as soon as the page is loaded (this used to be the default).
When disabled, the video starts loading only when the "play" button is pressed.

New interface languages available: Bulgarian, Welsh and Lombard

New dependency required: `tzdata`.

An HTTP proxy can be configured directly in Invidious, if needed. \
**NOTE:** In that case, it is recommended to comment out `force_resolve`.


### New features & important changes

#### For users

* Channels: Fix "Youtube API returned error 400" error preventing channel pages from loading
* Channels: Shorts can now be sorted by "newest", "oldest" and "popular"
* Preferences: Addition of the new "preload" option
* New interface languages available: Bulgarian, Welsh and Lombard
* Added "Filipino (auto-generated)" to the list of caption languages available
* Lots of new translations from Weblate

#### For instance owners

* Allow the configuration of an HTTP proxy to talk to Youtube
* Invidious tries to reconnect to `inv_sig_helper` if the socket is closed
* The instance list is downloaded in the background to improve redirection speed
* New `colorize_logs` option makes each log level a different color

#### For developpers

* `/api/v1/channels/{id}/shorts` now supports the `sort-by` parameter with the following values:
  `newest`, `oldest` and `popular`
* Older `/api/v1/channels/xyz/{id}` (tab name before UCID) were removed
* API/Search: New video metadata available: `isNew`, `is4k`, `is8k`, `isVr180`, `isVr360`,
  `is3d` and `hasCaptions`

### Bugs fixed

#### User-side

* Channels: The second page of shorts now loads as expected
* Channels: Fixed intermittent empty "playlists" tab
* Search: Fixed `youtu.be` URLs not being properly redirected to the watch page
* Fixed `DB::MappingException` error on the subscriptions feed (due to missing `tzdata` in docker)
* Switching to another instance is much faster

## v2.20240825.0 (2024-08-25)

### New features & important changes

#### For users

* The search bar now has a button that you can click!
* Youtube URLs can be pasted directly in the search bar. Prepend search query with a
  backslash (`\`) to disable that feature (useful if you need to search for a video whose
  title contains some youtube URL).
* On the channel page the "streams" tab can be sorted by either: "newest", "oldest" or "popular"
* Lots of translations have been updated (thanks to our contributors on Weblate!)
* Videos embedded in local HTML files (e.g: a webpage saved from a blog) can now be played

#### For instance owners

* Invidious now has the ability to provide a `po_token` and `visitordata` to Youtube in order to
  circumvent current Youtube restrictions.
* Invidious can use an (optional) external signature server like [inv_sig_helper]. Please note that
  some videos can't be played without that signature server.
* The Helm charts were moved to a separate repo: https://github.com/iv-org/invidious-helm-chart
* We have changed how containers are released: the `latest` tag now tracks tagged releases, whereas
  the `master` tag tracks the most recent commits of the `master` branch ("nightly" builds).

[inv_sig_helper]: https://github.com/iv-org/inv_sig_helper

#### For developpers

* The versions of Crystal that we test in CI/CD are now: `1.9.2`, `1.10.1`, `1.11.2`, `1.12.1`.
  Please note that due to a bug in the `libxml` bindings (See [#4256]), versions prior to `1.10.0`
  are not recommended to use.
* Thanks to @syeopite, the code is now [ameba] compliant.
* Ameba is part of our CI/CD pipeline, and its rules will be enforced in future PRs.
* The transcript code has been rewritten to permit transcripts as a feature rather than being
  only a workaround for captions. Trancripts feature is coming soon!
* Various fixes regarding the logic interacting with Youtube
* The `sort_by` parameter can be used on the `/api/v1/channels/{id}/streams` endpoint. Accepted
  values are: "newest", "oldest" and "popular"

### Bugs fixed

#### User-side

* Channels: fixed broken "subscribers" and "views" counters
* Watch page: playback position is reset at the end of a video, so that the next time this video
  is watched, it will start from the beginning rather than 15 seconds before the end
* Watch page: the items in the "add to playlist" drop down are now sorted alphabetically
* Videos: the "genre" URL is now always pointing to a valid webpage
* Playlists: Fixed `Could not parse N episodes` error on podcast playlists
* All external links should now have the [`rel`] attibute set to `noreferrer noopener` for
  increased privacy.
* Preferences: Fixed the admin-only "modified source code" input being ignored
* Watch/channel pages: use the full image URL in `og:image` and `twitter:image` meta tags

[`rel`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel

#### API

* fixed the `local` parameter not applying to `formatStreams` on `/api/v1/videos/{id}`
* fixed an `Index out of bounds` error hapenning when a playlist had no videos
* fixed duplicated query parameters in proxied video URLs
* Return actual video height/width/fps rather than hard coded values
* Fixed the `/api/v1/popular` endpoint not returning a proper error code/message when the
  popular page/endpoint are disabled.
