### Extensions

We highly recommend the use of [Privacy Redirect](https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect#get),
a browser extension that automatically redirects YouTube URLs to any Invidious instance and replaces
embedded YouTube videos on other websites with Invidious.

The documentation contains a list of browser extensions that we recommended to use along with Invidious.
